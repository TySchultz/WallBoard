# WallBoard
My old iPad 2 was never getting used. So I decided to attach it to the wall and turn it into a statusBoard of sorts. 
Displays the current time, temperature, court schedule, and forcast.

## Features
##### Time
Basically a glorified wall clock. It displays the current time (AM-PM) and the current date (Wednesday, June 24th)
##### Weather 
The current temperature pulled from forcast.io along with the high and low for the day.
##### Court schedule
An easy way to check which basketball courts at the RPAC (Ohio State Rec facility) were available for basketball. Pulled the schedule from https://recsports.osu.edu/schedule/ and parsed the items for basketball. 
##### Forcast  
Using the data from forcast.io it displays the future temperature in 2 hour increments.
##### Video Background
The new apple tv screensavers are amazing to look at. Thanks Benjamin Mayo for finding the links to the videos!  http://benjaminmayo.co.uk/watch-all-the-apple-tv-aerial-video-screensavers#b7-1
